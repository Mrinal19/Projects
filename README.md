## Reinforcement Learning based Music Recommendation System 
This repository implements a personalized music recommendation engine using a reinforcement learning approach. It addresses the challenge of interactive recommendation by formulating the problem as a contextual multi-armed bandit. The system learns user preferences, recommends new songs, and incorporates user feedback (ratings) to refine its recommendations. This is part of a reinforcement learning-based case study/project.

### Key Features:

- ``Reinforcement Learning``: Employs a reinforcement learning algorithm to solve the exploration-exploitation trade-off and cold-start problem, ensuring diverse and effective recommendations even for new users.
- ``Contextual Multi-Armed Bandit``: Formulates the recommendation process as a contextual multi-armed bandit, where each "arm" represents a song, and the context is a feature vector combining user preferences and song attributes.
- ``Reward-Based Learning``: Leverages user ratings as rewards to guide the recommendation process. The system learns from feedback to improve its future recommendations.
- ``Content-Based Filtering Integration``: Enhances the recommendation accuracy by incorporating a content-based approach to suggest songs similar to those the user has enjoyed.


### How it Works:

- **User Profile**: The system starts by building a user profile. Initially, new users provide ratings for a few recommended songs. These ratings serve as valuable feedback to learn their preferences.
- **Recommendation and Rating**: The system recommends songs one by one. The user listens to the song and provides a rating.
- **User Profile Update**: Based on the song features and the user's rating, the system updates the user's preference vector (theta) to reflect their evolving taste.
- **Next Recommendation**: Using the updated user profile, the system calculates the utility of each song and recommends the song with the highest predicted utility score.
